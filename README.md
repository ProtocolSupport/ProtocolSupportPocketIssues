# About Bedrock Edition in ProtocolSupport (PSPE)

The `mcpenew` branch of ProtocolSupport offers pre-alpha quality support for connecting with PE clients to a Java server.

*Note that this functionality is still in development. It is not even beta quality.*

At this point, we do not need additional beta testers. However, we do need more developers. Everyone with adequate Java knowledge willing to help us with is more than welcome! Please join the `#mcpe` channel on our Discord.

# Download PSPE Releases

At this point we do not offer any prebuilt PSPE plugin. If you cannot compile it yourself, it is unlikely that you can help us with the needed development efforts. When the project becomes mature enough to expose to a wider range of users for beta testing, we will provide a jar for download.
